## Simple Todo
The main purpose of this app is to provide a playground for me to test things I am incorporating in a different project. This is a "learning app" and is not meant to represent a finished product. The code here could be in various states of refactoring so it may not adhere to best practices (read: the code may be ugly). 
  

## Technology used
  * Svelte  - used for the front end functionality (https://svelte.dev)
  * Bulma   - used to provide the UI styles (https://bulma.io)
  * FaunaDB - used to provide a GraphQl back end (https://fauna.com/)
  * Netlify - used for hosting and to provide Lambad function capability. (https://netlify.com)
  * Cypress - used for end to end testing (https://www.cypress.io/)
